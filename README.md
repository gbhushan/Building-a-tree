# Building-a-tree

Clean JS files, no jquery needed

//TO-DO write about using modular/revealing module pattern, having a NS and using "new" keyword as a constructor
// future enhancements:
1. start a node server and create a simple DB with 2 tables:- states and cities
2. On "GET", I should get a json file containing all the records from the 2 tables
3. construct the a tree checkbox from the json
